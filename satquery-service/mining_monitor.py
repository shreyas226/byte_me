"""Mining expansion alert-check specialist (Track A).

Detects bare-soil / excavation expansion between two real Sentinel-2
acquisitions over a monitored mining region, and raises a `land_change` alert
when the expansion exceeds a configurable threshold OR when a material share of
the newly bare ground falls outside the region's boundary polygon.

REUSE, NOT REIMPLEMENTATION
    The spectral work is done entirely by the existing deterministic engine:
      • compute_landcover_breakdown()  → built-up/bare share per date (NDBI)
      • compute_change_area()          → thresholded change pixels + km²
      • get_pixel_dimensions_meters()  → geotransform → real-world pixel size
    This module only selects scenes, windows the rasters, differences the
    land-cover shares and applies thresholds.

BOUNDARY CAVEAT
    Region boundaries are APPROXIMATIONS (see mining_regions.py). The
    "outside boundary" signal is a coarse spatial cue for triage — never
    evidence of lease encroachment. Every alert this module raises carries
    `boundary_is_approximate` and the caveat text in its computed_metrics so the
    qualification travels with the number into the UI.
