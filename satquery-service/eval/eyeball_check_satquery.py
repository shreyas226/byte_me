"""
Eyeball sanity-check for satquery-service/eval/run_benchmark.py scoring logic.

Exercises compute_soft_match (including the 'mountains' whole-word fix) and
compute_bleu_n against the 5+5 sanity-check samples without loading the GPU model.

Predictions are hand-crafted to cover the cases that have historically broken:
  - Substring match bug ("mountainous" ≠ "mountain" after the whole-word fix)
  - Contiguous-alias matching ("adjacent to water" must appear consecutively)
  - Exact match vs soft match for yes/no questions

Run from the repo root:
    python satquery-service/eval/eyeball_check_satquery.py

No GPU, no model loading required.
